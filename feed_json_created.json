This is exceptionally fast, able\nto load 3 years of national crime data (~18m incidents, England &amp; Wales) from over 1500 individual parquet files, and\ngroup the crimes into 200m hex cells (~1.5m) - all in well under 10 seconds.</p>\n<p>We've previously used Streamlit as a front-end (see\n<a href=\"https://uol-a011-prd-uks-wkld025-asp1-app1.azurewebsites.net\">here</a>) but it's also not scaling well, proving somewhat\ninflexible and has compatibility issues with duckdb, so we're looking at alternatives.

In this article we taker a deeper dive into this claim.</p>\n<p>Recall that our <em>null hypothesis</em> was that crimes are not concentrated, crime is is no more or less likely to occur\nin any given spatial unit, and the chance of a crime occurrence is not affected by previous events.</p>\n<h2>Motivating example - Seasonality</h2>\n<p>Public crime data in the UK contains precise (but obfuscated) location data, imprecise temporal information (the month\nof occurrence) and broad categorical information (around a dozen categories). Taking 3 years of data for incidents of\nASB in West Yorkshire, aggregating crime into spatial units (in this case LSOA) we can plot a graph of (naive) Gini over time.</p>\n<p><em>[ASB]: antisocial behaviour\n</em>[LSOA]: a statistical (census) geography containing roughly 2000 residents</p>\n<p>This graph shows some clear seasonality - concentration increases in the winter and decreases in the summer. A fairly\nobvious explanation for this would be that since antisocial behaviour generally occurs outdoors, there are simply more\noutdoor gatherings in warmer weather and longer daylight hours, therefore more opportunities.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Gini seasonality\" src=\"../../img/gini-seasonality.png\"></p>\n<p>However, more careful analysis of the data shows the apparent seasonality <strong>is an illusion</strong>.

Older people are more likely to be victims of certain crimes, for instance, and for others there are often\ncorrelations between crime incidence and the deprivation, socioeconomic status or other makeup of the area.</p>\n<p>The UK census is the biggest source of demographic data, providing many attributes over various spatial scales. With\ncensus data there is always a tradeoff between spatial and categorical resolutions, often to preserve anonymity. For\nexample, the highest spatial resolution for counts of people by age in years is MSOA, and at higher resolutions\n(LSOA, OA) age is only given in 5-year bands.</p>\n<p><em>[MSOA]: Middle-layer Super Output Area\n</em>[LSOA]: Lower-layer Super Output Area\n*[OA]: Output Area</p>\n<p>Another very important consideration is that we will want to aggregate people to non-statistical geographies, such as\ngrids and hexes. In order to do this, we could simply place people at random points within the statistical geography,\nthen take those that fall within the new geography.
