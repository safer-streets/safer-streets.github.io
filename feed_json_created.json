What measures are traditionally used?</li>\n<li>if crime is purely random and thus <em>isn't</em> concentrated in any meaningful sense, will we still measure\nsome concentration using traditional measures?</li>\n<li>can we develop a \"null hypothesis\" statistical model to create a baseline measure, allowing us to differentiate\nbetween random and structural effects?
