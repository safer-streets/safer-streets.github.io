This is exceptionally fast, able\nto load 3 years of national crime data (~18m incidents, England &amp; Wales) from over 1500 individual parquet files, and\ngroup the crimes into 200m hex cells (~1.5m) - all in well under 10 seconds.</p>\n<p>We've previously used Streamlit as a front-end (see\n<a href=\"https://uol-a011-prd-uks-wkld025-asp1-app1.azurewebsites.net\">here</a>) but it's also not scaling well, proving somewhat\ninflexible and has compatibility issues with duckdb, so we're looking at alternatives.

Older people are more likely to be victims of certain crimes, for instance, and for others there are often\ncorrelations between crime incidence and the deprivation, socioeconomic status or other makeup of the area.</p>\n<p>The UK census is the biggest source of demographic data, providing many attributes over various spatial scales. With\ncensus data there is always a tradeoff between spatial and categorical resolutions, often to preserve anonymity. For\nexample, the highest spatial resolution for counts of people by age in years is MSOA, and at higher resolutions\n(LSOA, OA) age is only given in 5-year bands.</p>\n<p><em>[MSOA]: Middle-layer Super Output Area\n</em>[LSOA]: Lower-layer Super Output Area\n*[OA]: Output Area</p>\n<p>Another very important consideration is that we will want to aggregate people to non-statistical geographies, such as\ngrids and hexes. In order to do this, we could simply place people at random points within the statistical geography,\nthen take those that fall within the new geography. However this can be unrealistic, particularly in areas that are\nrural or contain large-scale non-residential infrastructure or bodies of water (despite Monty Python's boasts, nobody\nin Yorkshire lives under a lake!).</p>", "image": null, "date_modified": "2025-11-18T16:56:01.652131+00:00", "date_published": "2025-09-15T00:00:00+00:00", "authors": [{"name": "Andrew Smith"}], "tags": null}, {"id": "http://safer-streets.github.io/blog/2025/08/22/measuring-crime-concentration-part-1/", "url": "http://safer-streets.github.io/blog/2025/08/22/measuring-crime-concentration-part-1/", "title": "Measuring Crime Concentration (Part 1)", "content_html": "<h1>Measuring Crime Concentration (Part 1)</h1>\n<p>What constitutes concentration?
