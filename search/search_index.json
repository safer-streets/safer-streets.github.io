A quick analysis reveals some drawbacks to the measure (see below). For our purposes we made the following requirements for a useful clumpiness measure:</p> <ul> <li>essential:<ul> <li>scale invariant (i.e. adimensionless quantity)</li> <li>intuitive scale with known bounds, e.g. 0 for completely dispersed, 1 for a single cluster with minimal perimeter</li> </ul> </li> <li>desirable<ul> <li>agnostic to the shape of the (regular) geometry</li> <li>works with irregular geometries (e.g. census geographies)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>The clumpiness index as described by Adepeju satisfies only one of these requirements. While we can replicate their example, it is inconsistent with the FRAGSTATS documentation, requires a regular (square) grid, is potentially prone to discontinuities The value is hard to interpret and is rather counter intuitively impacted by the size of the background surrounding the features.</p> <p>As a result we decided to create our own clumpiness measure. A simple area/perimeter ratio is not scale invariant, nor is it intuitive.</p> <p>We argue that scale is integral to any measure: consider two disjoint squares of side $x$. At a length scale of $x$ this is a completely dispersed arrangement - two separate \"units\" and a \"clumpiness\" value of 0 would be appropriate. However, consider the same geometry at a scale of $x/2$ - it becomes two clusters of 4 \"unit\" squares and is thus, to some degree, clumpy. As the spatial scale is decrease this arrangement must be considered to be more and more clumped.</p> <p>Conversely, applying a large length scale (say $10x$) on this arrangement becomes somewhat meaningless, so the length scale has a lower bound approximately represented by the smallest feature of the geometry.</p> <p>Having now established that a representative length scale must be supplied to any unambiguous clumpiness calculation, it can also be used to render quantities dimensionless (between length and areal units)</p> <p>To this end we compute lower and upper bounds, in units of the length scale $s$, for the perimeter of a square-based geometry with a given area $A$.</p> <p>$$ P_{min} = 4\\sqrt{A} $$</p> <p>and the upper bound corresponds to $N=A/s^2$ disjoint length-unit squares:</p> <p>$$ P_{max} = 4sN = \\frac{4A}{s} $$</p> <p>The clumpiness - the perimeter of the geometry in question - must then lie in between these two values (assuming a valid length scale has been chosen) and can be normalised:</p> <p>$$ CI = \\frac{P_{max} - P}{P_{max} - P_{min}} $$</p> <p>thus yielding a value of 0 for fully disjoint geometries (at the given length scale) and 1 for a geometry that minimises the perimeter (a square in this case)</p> <p>  For a more practical demonstration, we compute the clumpiness of geometries starting with a fully-disjoint 11x11 geometry (left), gradually filling in empty squares until left with a single large square (right). The resulting curve is:</p> <p></p> <p>This index can easily be applied to non-square regular geometries and even irregular geometries.</p> <p>When applying this measure to real data, we can apply it in a number of ways: firstly measuring the clumpiness of all spatial units that contain a crime in a given period, but also filtering spatial units to cover only the top $N%$ of crimes - that is, the smallest number of spatial units required to capture $N%$ of crime.</p> <p>Applying this to real data shows that clumpiness index is very stable from month to month, decreases as we filter crimes, and increases with coarser grids:</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>With results like this it's open to debate whether this measure is particularly useful or insightful. It doesn't detect seasonal variation in concentration, at least at the scale tested (some other measures do), it's not scale-invariant and the spatial trend is one we'd expect for any input. If temporal and/or spatial scales can be found that maximise the clumpiness index, then it may become useful.</p>","tags":["Lorenz curve","Gini Coefficient","Poisson distribution"]},{"location":"blog/2025/07/31/comparison-of-crime-concentration-measures/#kde","title":"KDE","text":"<p> <code>kde-sampling.ipynb</code></p> <p>KDE sampling allows us to create a spatial distribution for crimes based on sampled location data (blue points below).

If we consider crimes to be i.i.d. Poisson processes for each state, then a perfectly even distribution is actually a (very) low entropy, (highly) improbable, state for the system. Consider $C$ crimes occuring in $N$ units. Since we can't have fractional crimes, a perfectly even distribution is only possible if $C$ is an integer multiple of $N$.</p> <p>Taking the case where $C=N$, the probability of one crime per state is given by $N!/N^N$, which very quickly vanishes as $N$ increases, so much so that if N is 750 or more, the probability cannot be represented in double precision arithmetic.</p> N p 10 0.0003 30 1e-12 100 9e-43 300 2e-129 1000 ~0 (not representable) <p>Since crime analysis would typically have $N\\gg 100$ and also because typically $C&lt;N$, this does not seem to be a suitable reference for a concentration calculation. Bernasco and Steenbeck have gone some way to address this, suggesting a reference described by the line $y=\\text{max}(Nx/C,1)$, which is the equivalent of $C$ states containing 1 crime, and $N-C$ states empty.

But we can just use the highest entropy state as the reference curve, which just happens to be the scaled PDF of the (assumed) Poisson distribution - in other words there will likely be a mixture of counts in each state, depending in the intensity ($C/N$) of the Poisson process.
